# Supermarket Kata
A coding kata for implementing a new component in the context of an already existing software.

This kata is inspired by the kata [Back to the Checkout](http://codekata.com/kata/kata09-back-to-the-checkout/) from [codekata.com](http://codekata.com).

## Instructions

### Instructions for the participants
There are instructions available to be handed out to the participants. They are available in the following languages:

- English: [Tasks](Tasks.md)
- German: [Aufgaben](Aufgaben.md)

We have good experiences in handing out the instructions task by task. This helps the participants focussing on the task at hand.

## Code of the initial system
There is source code for the initial system.

Currently this kata is available in the following languages:
- [C#](CSharp/) (.NET 4.x)
- [Java](java/) - Thanks to @rolger for the contribution
