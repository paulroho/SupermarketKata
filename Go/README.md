## Supermarket Kata in [Go](https://www.golang.org)

This implementation requires Go in version 1.7 or compatible.

### Setup

This project uses relative import paths, in order to avoid having a name of a person in the in the package path. This avoids problems after forking the kata repo.

You will need to install the BDD framework [Godog](https://github.com/DATA-DOG/godog).
